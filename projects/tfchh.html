            The game challenges players with fast-paced, real-time management. Players must dispatch
            delivery drivers with incoming
            orders, strategizing around varied driver speeds and capacities to ensure all orders are
            delivered on time.
            Maximize your score by delivering as many orders as possible before running out of lives, which
            are lost by not delivering on time.
            <br><br>
            A fast-paced game prototype developed and delivered within a 48-hour game jam.

            Served as the Team Lead and Main Programmer for a team consisting of me and two Unity rookies. I
            focused on
            establishing the project structure and clear task delegation, resulting in a
            successful submission. Authored the fundamental gameplay architecture, including the Game
            Manager, Order Manager, and Score Manager. Implemented all core UI programming, including
            efficient UI highlight logic, ensuring a smooth and functional user experience.
