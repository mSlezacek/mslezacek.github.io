            <br><br>
            My primary motivation for this project was to build complex game systems from the ground up, to
            help me understand the architectural backbone of most games and how the plug-in systems
            available from third parties work under the hood. This led me to create a small technical
            playground for my systems. I knew I wanted to focus on clean architecture from the start, even
            without prior experience building similar complex systems. The only related experience I had was
            building the effect system for "The King of Blackjack." I used the insights from that project to
            focus on the strong parts of Scriptable Objects, build these systems slowly with focus on proper
            architecture above all else.
