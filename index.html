                    <p class="project-description">
                        A unique blend of Blackjack and roguelike elements. Players build a dynamic deck of cards by
                        betting them in Blackjack, which is then used in combat. Cards feature custom, systemic effects
                        based on rarity, triggering effects on hit (e.g., fire, execute, slow) or as passive effects
                        while held in left hand (e.g., bonus damage, AOE damage nearby player). The goal is to defeat
                        rounds of enemies and
                        progress to higher rounds.
                        <br><br>
                        This project was a 3 person team effort developed at Masaryk university as part of Game development
                        course.
                        <br>
                        I focused on engineering the backend, creating the flexible Card Effect System utilizing the
                        Mediator pattern to manage
                        countless card combinations without dependency issues. I also authored the core Player
                        Controller, ensuring polished movement and reliable interaction via a custom raycast-based
                        ground check.

                        continously spawning flowers to lower your anxiety, use gnomes as grenades against flowers and

                        <br><br>
                        My primary motivation for this project was to build complex game systems from the ground up, to
                        help me understand the architectural backbone of most games and how the plug-in systems
                        available from third parties work under the hood. This led me to create a small technical
                        playground for my systems. I knew I wanted to focus on clean architecture from the start, even
                        without prior experience building similar complex systems. The only related experience I had was
                        building the effect system for "The King of Blackjack." I used the insights from that project to
                        focus on the strong parts of Scriptable Objects, build these systems slowly with focus on proper
                        architecture above all else.
